# Cinemagic

## Project Description

Cinemagic is a web application that enables movie enthusiasts to buy their favorite films. Users can easily search for movies by name, sort them by genre or alphabetically, even add them to their favorites. By clicking on the movie's image on the home page, users can access the tutorial and the movie details. The 'Favorites' page allows users to sort movies by duration and rating, while the 'Cart' page displays selected movies and provides a form for completing the order.

### Technologies Used:

We utilized the following technologies to create Cinemagic:

- **Node.js and Express.js**: These technologies are essential for building and managing the server-side components of our applications, including APIs and database interactions.
- **MongoDbCompass**: To store some information in the database
- **React**: A popular web application library known for its effectiveness in creating interactive and dynamic UI components.
- **SCSS**: To customize the design of our application.

### Challenges

During development, we faced the following challenges:

- The fetch on the Movie API didnâ€™t work as we expected, so we selected the movies we wanted and created our own database with the help of the API information.
